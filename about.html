            <h2>I'm John Smith</h2>
            <p>The scent of hay was in the air through the lush meadows beyond Pyrford, and the hedges on either side were sweet and gay with multitudes of dog-roses. The heavy firing that had broken out while we were driving down Maybury Hill ceased as abruptly as it began, leaving the evening very peaceful and still. &nbsp;We got to Leatherhead without misadventure about nine o'clock, and the horse had an hour's rest while I took supper with my cousins and commended my wife to their care.</p>
            <p>My wife was curiously silent throughout the drive, and seemed oppressed with forebodings of evil. &nbsp;I talked to her reassuringly, pointing out that the Martians were tied to the Pit by sheer heaviness, and at the utmost could but crawl a little out of it; but she answered only in monosyllables. &nbsp;Had it not been for my promise to the innkeeper, she would, I think, have urged me to stay in Leatherhead that night. &nbsp;Would that I had! &nbsp;Her face, I remember, was very white as we parted.</p>
